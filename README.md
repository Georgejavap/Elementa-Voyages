### üîπ Lighthouse Metrics (Before Optimizations)  

| Metric | Before | Notes / Issues Identified |
|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** | 2.5 s | Hero banner and destination images were large and slow to render |
| **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** | 6.8 s | Main images not optimized; blocked page rendering |
| **Total Blocking Time (TBT)** | 350 ms | Render-blocking CSS & JS delayed interactivity |
| **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** | 0.12 | Layout shifted during page load due to missing image dimensions |
| **Speed Index** | 4.2 s | Slow visual load due to heavy assets |

**Key Issues Identified:**  
- Large uncompressed images (JPEG/PNG)  
- Render-blocking CSS and JavaScript files  
- Missing width/height attributes on images  
- No lazy-loading implemented for hero and feature images  

---

### üîπ Lighthouse Metrics (After Optimizations)

### Google Maps API & JavaScript Implementation  

**Purpose:** To provide an **interactive map feature** for users to locate destinations visually and interact with custom markers and info windows.  

**Implementation Details:**  
- **Google Maps JavaScript API**: Included via a `<script>` tag in `index.html` and other Destination pages. Example snippet:

```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap" async defer></script>


Initialization Function (initMap):

- Defined in biome.js or script.js
- Sets the map center coordinates, zoom level, and map type
- Adds custom markers for each destination with latitude/longitude
- Attaches info windows with destination names and brief descriptions

Functionality:

 -Users can zoom, pan, and click markers to view destination info.
- Map updates are dynamic, and markers are scalable if more destinations are added.
- The JavaScript is modular, allowing for future enhancements like filtering by biome   or category.
```
